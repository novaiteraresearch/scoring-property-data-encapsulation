Related Frameworks authored by FURLOW ARIEL J. (direct analogs: numeric targets + readiness scoring)



- **Information Density Target** (1–10)
- **Technical Depth Target** (1–10)
- **YAML Compliance Target** (1–10)
- **AI Confidence Target** (computed / formula, described as 1–10 desired confidence)
- **Action Item Emphasis**, **Decision Emphasis**, **Key Topic Emphasis** (1–10 emphasis scales)
- **Context Window Usage Target (%)** (numeric target)
- **Deployment Readiness Score** exists as a separate score concept in the workspace (see below)

### Standalone scoring specs / formulas (explicit scoring frameworks)

- **Deployment Readiness Score Formula** (a weighted score spec for prompt deployment readiness).
- **Probabilistic Confidence Scoring Framework for Prompt Validation** (explicit “scoring framework” page).
- **Cognitive Complexity Measurement (Transcript/Session Scoring) — v1** 
- **Context Transfer Intelligence Report — Research Value Assessment Framework** (contains scoring logic sections, e.g., point allocations and normalization).

### “Score-like” metrics inside **Research Document Tracker**

Additionally, Furlow has developed database fields that behave like scoring/measurement concepts (even when not 1–10), such as **Content Density Score** and other metric-style summaries.[
